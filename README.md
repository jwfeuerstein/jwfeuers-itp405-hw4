# ITP 405 Assignment 4: Final Project Proposal
### Jason Feuerstein

## Project Title: NBA Lineup Builder

1. The goal of this application is to allow users to build, customize, and compare NBA player lineups. Users will be able to select existing lineups for current NBA teams or build their own lineups. Each lineup will display data including combined points/rebounds/assists per game, average player efficiency rating, and average field goal percentage. 

2. The primary audience of this application will be NBA fans. Specifically, it will target NBA fans who are interested in data and statistics. It will allow them to explore different player combinations to determine which lineups are most effective and observe statistics related to their favorite teams and players. 

3. The create part of CRUD will include creating new player lineups. Users will be able to select which players they want in their lineup then add it to the database. The read part of CRUD will include getting data for each existing lineup. Users will be able to click on a particular lineup and view a page that displays relevant data for that lineup. The update part of CRUD will include modifying existing lineups. Users will be able to change the players for each lineup, which will then be reflected by changes to the database. The delete part of CRUD will include removing lineups. Users can delete lineups from the site, which will then be reflected by changes to the database. 

4. The additional feature I will implement will be a bookmarking system that allows users to save particular lineups to a "My Lineups" page. This will allow users to keep track of their favorite lineups without having to search through the entire list each time. This will make the application more user-friendly and will decrease the amount of time users have to spend parsing through the list of lineups.
